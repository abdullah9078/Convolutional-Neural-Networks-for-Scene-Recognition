# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Scene-Recognition

The study explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning for scene recognition using the extensive 'Places2 simp' dataset with 40,000 unique images, achieved remarkable top-1 accuracy of 45% and top-5 accuracy of 75%. optimising CNN architectures, refining training strategies and investigating more inventive pre-processing and data augmentation techniques. for real-world applications.
